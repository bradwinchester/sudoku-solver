# Command Line Sudoku Solver
This project aims to solve the majority of sudoku puzzles using algorithms that mimmick the steps a human player would take. It is significantly more complex than creating a brute force solver, so this project will be the framework for a future GUI-based solver which will include more features such as puzzle generation and hints.
